## Project Overview
This repository contains the development artifacts for a barcode and QR code scanning application designed to enhance the functionality of Standard Bots' robotic systems. This application exemplifies a seamless integration of cutting-edge computer vision technology with user-centric design principles to enhance operational efficiency in industrial automation.

<br>

## Objective
The main goal of this project was to develop a highly intuitive and efficient tool for integrating barcode and QR code scanning capabilities into Standard Bots' existing robotic control systems, thereby reducing operational complexity and improving the user interaction with the machinery.

## Features and Functionalities
- **Barcode Detection**: Enables the robots to read and interpret various types of barcodes.
- **QR Code Integration**: Allows for QR code scanning to support a wide range of industrial applications.
- **User-Centric Design**: A simple and intuitive user interface that supports seamless interaction between the user and the robotic system.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Immediate processing and visualization of the scanning results, enhancing user decision-making.

<br>

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for developing the scanning algorithms and backend integration.
- **OpenCV**: Utilized for implementing the core image processing and scanning functionalities.
- **Figma**: Used to design and prototype the user interface before implementation.
- **Pyzbar**: A Python library used for decoding barcodes and QR codes.
- **QRCode**: A Python library used to generate QR codes.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: For handling image file operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For displaying images and results within the notebook.
