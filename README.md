[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XYhJWEjsE7C9vP6csqLb9nt69XlYHRkg?usp=sharing)

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the integration of barcode and QR code scanning functionalities as part of a take-home project for Standard Bots. The project aligns with a user flow diagram and a Figma prototype to provide a comprehensive view of the application's functionality. This setup showcases both the detection and decoding capabilities, explaining how these technologies can be dynamically implemented within a broader system.

## Features
- **Barcode Detection**: Detects barcodes from images using the `pyzbar` library.
- **QR Code Detection and Generation**: Generates and detects QR codes to demonstrate end-to-end functionality.
- **Interactive Visuals**: Includes interactive plots to visually demonstrate the results of barcode and QR code scanning.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for the project.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and barcode detection.
- **Pyzbar**: A Python library used for decoding barcodes and QR codes.
- **QRCode**: A Python library used to generate QR codes.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: For handling image file operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For displaying images and results within the notebook.
